# Spreadsheet Analysis
A little assignment to practice finding data, munging it, and analyzing it in a spreadsheet program.

# Analysis

Performing analysis on the data was challenging as there are no strict numbers, so what we did instead was we looked at the common crime that leads to an arrest. using an COUNTIF function along with a max function to effectively calculate the MODE of the data. We did this for season, borough and age. Another way this could have been achieved is through a pivot table which is also used for the most common crime that leads to an arrest. This analysis gains the additional insight that shows that property is the common crime that leads to an arrest, which is interesting to note. It also shows that most arrests happen in Brooklyn, and it shows that crimes are relatively spread-out during seasons with a light dip in winter as seen by the graph. For age not surprisingly the largest age range is 25-44 has the highest arrests.

This is the attached pivot table.
